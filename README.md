## Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD candidate in Computational Neuroscience / Neural Engineering at Duke University,

My primary research focuses on probabilistic modeling and inference for neural signals. Much of my the work is still in active development so stay tuned for when it is ready to be open to the public!

## 🔬 Research Interests
- Brain–computer interfaces (BCI)
- Closed Loop Experimentaiton
- Large-scale neural population dynamics
- Neural/Brain realted technologies
- Computational Neuroscience/AI tool development

## 🔬 Technical Skills
- Probabilistic inference and EM-style algorithms
- Gradient-based optimization for latent models
- High-dimensional statistics for neural data
- Research-grade engineering with JAX

## Relevant Hobbies/Projects
- Local AI integration
- Home Lab Development
- 3D Modeling,Designing, and Printing
